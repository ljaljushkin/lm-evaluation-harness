{"text": " to answer a user's question, which will begin in the next message.What causes a rainbow to change colors?A rain drop causes a rainbow to appear.  In the early part of the natural process, the drop creates turbulence in the air.  The turbulence causes air molecules in front of and behind the drop to collide, but these collisions cause the drop to spin as it falls.  The spinning drop then continues to fall, so that by the time it gets to land on the ocean, it is thousands of miles above the water.  If you are standing there looking at this very rarest of sights, you will see a rainbow after a rain drop lands on a leaf!  Then there is the phenomenon called an optical illusion.  If you look down at that very same spot of the water, you will see that you have not clearly seen the water below the surface of the water.  This is because the light that falls on any one spot of the drop is absorbed pretty much instantly by all the water in front of it.  When this light hits any different color of drops, like blue and green, or red, green and blue, it causes a light reflection.  The reflected light also happens to the back scatter the"}

{"text": " a helpful AI designed to answer questions.In computational biology, the hypothesis-test-statistic hypothesis, or the null hypothesis, is a statistical hypothesis used in hypothesis testing that states that the null hypothesis is true. Hypothesis-tests are tests of the hypothesis about the hypothesis-null hypothesis (null hypothesis) vs the hypothesis (alternative hypothesis). The null hypothesis of testing is the same as any other hypothesis; in some senses, they are redundant, since the null hypothesis is a statement about what hypothesis you are testing. The significance of the test statistic is an important consideration during hypothesis testing.\nFor example, if an alternative hypothesis is stated, the p-value of the test statistic is important in deciding the significance of the test. A rejective outcome, for example, indicates evidence against the null hypothesis, but not necessarily so for a rejected null. If an alpha level can be set above, e.g., 0.05, then no conclusions need to be drawn. In general, the null hypothesis is rejected if the test statistic's associated probability falls to (or below) an alpha value. The probability is typically given as a percentage instead of a significance level; because the alternative hypothesis is usually rejected, this probability is sometimes called a p"}

Maybe it's just me, but it seems like potatoes are just perfect at blending different flavors. Explain like I'm five.While potatoes do have a rich and distinct flavor, cooking them properly can be tricky. For example, they do need to be cooked in different ways depending on how they are prepared. When they are raw, the starch from the potato has to soften and go away, while the potato flesh starts to brown and become crispy. To make potatoes taste great, the cook needs to use the right technique with the right type of potato. And even after cooking, the potatoes still need to be stored properly to keep them fresh for longer. So while potatoes do have some of their flavor, they must be cooked in different ways for successful cooking."}
